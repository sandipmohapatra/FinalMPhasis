ODBC 
------------
what the use of ODBC?
microsoft has inbuilt driver to connect to any database for our application.There are some default drivers present in it.example:- ms access,ms excel,Visual studio,Sql Server.
to connnect to other databases like oracle and my sql we have to down load the odbc driver.

we have ODBC for MACOS, Unix also.

Troubleshooting ODBC Connection Problems

While configuring a Connector/ODBC DSN, if we could Not Load Translator or Setup Library error occurs

The Connector/ODBC .dll (Windows) and .so (Linux) file names depend on several factors:

Connector/ODBC Version: A digit in the file name indicates the major Connector/ODBC version number. For example, a file named myodbc8w.dll is for Connector/ODBC 8.x whereas myodbc5w.dll is for Connector/ODBC 5.x.

Driver Type: The Unicode driver adds the letter "w" to file names to indicate that wild characters are supported. For example, myodbc8w.dll is for the Unicode driver. The ANSI driver adds the letter "a" instead of a "w", like myodbc8a.dll.

GUI Setup module: The GUI setup module files add the letter "S" to file names.

Enabling Debug Mode: typically debug mode is not enabled as it decreases performance. The driver must be compiled with debug mode enabled.
